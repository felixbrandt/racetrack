# RaceTrack
Study assignment for _Universal Windows Apps_ at _Hof University_.

## About
The app for ambitious hobby drivers that want to use their phone as a HUD while driving. Live display of location, speed, G-Force, tilt (for driving on motorcycles), lap and round time.

_This app runs fine while debugging in Visual Studio but needs some minor adjustments before it's ready for the store._
